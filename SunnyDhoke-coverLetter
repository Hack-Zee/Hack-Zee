“I‘m a final year undergraduate specializing in computer science and engineering. I currently work at All India Reporter/AIR Infotech and my team is working on developing a new smart chat assistant that’s set to go into legal database products this year. So, I’m interested in meeting people with similar backgrounds, I’m hoping to learn about the work environments in different companies.” 
I'm currently working on an AI assistant that will help All India Reporter in engaging more customers.
The product will be using technologies such as Stanford CoreNLP, seq2seq models and ChatterBot API.
